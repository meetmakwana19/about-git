# about-git
A single place where all I know about using Git and Github can be found.

A repository is a folder consisting of one or more than one file along with a hidden folder named as ".git".
This ".git" folder has all the information regarding our performed gut operations and handles all the git services.
".git' spits the required files we need into our working directory which is known as Repository.
